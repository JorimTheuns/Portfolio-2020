        <div class="bottom">
          <p>In 2018, a project of mine at DAE culminated in a film called: "Noi Contro Loro". It was about how a far-right politician in Italy used social media to present an authentic imago, all the while optimising their posts to maximise traction. I realised that part of what made the politcian succesful was that they proudly displayed attacks against them and they profited from they chaos they themselves engineered - They were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">antifragile</a>. Instead of contribute to the cacophony by publishing the film, I realised that working on the hidden layer - the root cause - might be more productive.</p>

          <p>What is needed is a pre-political mechanism that exposes individuals to different data - data that contradicts the facinating yet overly simplistic narratives that drive conspiracy and ideology. This mechanism must be pre-political, or else it would reinforce the idea that certain narratives are given an "unfair advantage" which could feed into further polarisation. </p>

          <p>I realised that political ideologies are collections of narratives that provide a framework in which people can understand their experience of society. There is a feedback loop at play here. Successful narratives change the society. This makes them more precient as tools to understand ones experience, which make them more successful - in an absurd spiral. </p>
