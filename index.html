              <p>In 2018, a project of mine at DAE culminated in a film called: "Noi Contro Loro". It was about how a far-right politician in Italy used social media to present an authentic imago, all the while optimising their posts to maximise traction. I realised that part of what made the politcian succesful was that they proudly displayed attacks against them and they profited from they chaos they themselves engineered - They were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">antifragile</a>. Instead of contribute to the cacophony by publishing the film, I realised that working on the hidden layer - the root cause - might be more productive.</p>

              <p class="top-pad"> Chaos scientists in the 1980's developed a technique called reccurence plotting, that allowed them to find higher order structure in chaotic systems. I recreated these reccurence plots for a number of systems, including a simple random number generator, and what struck me was this: with randomness, you can see the boundary of the canvas! Large numbers of random inputs allow you to be sure that the structure of the output is reflecting the structure of the higher order system (the plot), rather than some prior bias (the function).</p>

              <p>As an avid note taker, I was always frustrated that after taking a note, it ususally ended up gathering dust in a folder somewhere. My collection of notes was exactly that, a collection, with a strict, folder-based heirachy. Putting the theory I had learned during Dembrane and Unforgettable into practise lead me to cultivate a knowledge management system based on the principles of antifragility and rhyzomatics, with techniques from the world of linked open data.</p>

              <p>Indead of siloing all my information based on the process it was involved with, I started storing all my data in one interoperable file format called Markdown. Notes could now refer to oneanother, calendar items could link to reminders or contacts and vice versa. This is based on the file management principle called "Pillars, pipelines, vaults." All my pipelines could now draw from the same data vault. </p>

          This system is made possible through a cloudkit architecture, and is backed-up by automated commits to a private github repository using Cron-Jobs. Any app that can read markdown can now interface with the data vault. I currently use Obsidian to map the vault, Typeora to write long form, and Noteplan 3 to access the notes on my phone, push notifications, and to interface with reminders and calendars.</p>
