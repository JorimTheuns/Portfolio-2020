      <div class="text">
        <p>Sortition is a system of representative democratic selection - also known as Demarchy - which proposes to randomly select citizens to political office rather that selection by election (Stone, 2016). This thesis examines sortition through the lens of complexity theory and attempts to answer the question of to what extent work within the wide umbrella of complexity theory, but from completely different disciplines, can be linked together fruitfully. In answering this question, this thesis attempts to connect two areas of thought that may at first glance appear unrelated, or at worst contradictory, but upon closer inspection - and with a little imagination - have a great deal to offer one-another</p>
        <p>The first area concerns the work of Nassim N. Taleb, especially his concept of antifragility: defined as a positive, non-linear (convex) response to disorder or harm (Taleb, 2013). The second area mostly discusses the work of Rosi Braidotti, specifically the ontological frame of her work, and her writings on a unique moral framework called Ethics of Joy. This thesis will survey related writings in order to apprehend the ontological premises used in constructing this novel moral framework. Specifically, it will examine the non-trivial notions - that all matter is one substrate, that all matter is self-organising and that life gravitates around positivity (Braidotti, 2018b). From a synthesis of these concepts, this thesis proposes unique arguments in favour of sortition as political praxis.</p>
